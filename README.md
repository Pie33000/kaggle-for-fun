Kaggle-for-fun
==============================

All my submissions for Kaggle contests that I have been, and going to be participating.

Disclaimer: to me, Kaggle contest is not about writing perfect scalable, maintainable code, it's about getting the best result for submission, or, at least, beat the benchmark.

I will probably have everything written in Python (utilizing scikit-learn or similar libraries), but occasionally I might also use R or Haskell if I can.
